# ACS_Juvenile_Justice_Project
This project is based on ACS updated Flash report. The Flash report provides monthly performance data on key ACS child welfare, child care, and juvenile justice functions such as children using vouchers for child care, child protective caseloads, and the number of admissions to detention. Each row of data in the Excel file posted to Open Data is a distinct measure in the Flash Report.The columns are the month of the data. Data are updated semiannually in September and April using data from queries of administrative data systems and data provided directly from program areas.<br>

The IDE used in this project will be Google Colab notebook. <br>
